# TODO

- [x] Create base units based on **starcraft / tribal wars / travian** stats
- [ ] Decide on the battle system
- [ ] Add +1 attack upgrade per level to stakers
- [ ] Add phoenix can attack all units for the first 4 turns
- [ ] Refactor troop classes to use dataclasses properlly
- [ ] Add email confirmation to user_service


# Idea

Use travian units as base and theme as starcraft
Use tribalwars system for buildings with starcraft theme


## Shield Mechanic
units have 50% hp after battle, but shield will be 100%, they need to go back to ally base to get hp back to 100%
